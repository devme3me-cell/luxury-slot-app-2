📌 CROWN IMAGE PLACEHOLDER
================================

To replace the crown icon with your own image:

1. Add your crown image to this folder (public/)
2. Name it: crown-placeholder.png  (or .gif for animated)
3. Recommended size: 40x40 pixels or larger
4. Use PNG with transparent background for best results

The app will automatically use your image!

If no image is found, it will show a crown emoji (👑) as fallback.
